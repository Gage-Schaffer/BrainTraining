# BrainTraining
A repo for short programs that force my brain gears to turn. 

<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>A lot of the projects that I have worked on are closed-source and belong to my company. That is, I can't share my <b>glorious creations</b> with anyone. Emphasis on glorious. You'll have to trust me.</p>

<p>I figured that this repo would be a good way to share some of the small programs that I have written over time that make me flex my brain and show that I can write code. Most of these snippets will be in Python, but some might be in C++ for stuff that requires more intensive operations, such as finding large prime numbers via trial division.</p>

<h2>Contact</h2>
<p>I'd love to hear from anyone with critiques, ideas, or suggestions. Reach out to me via my email below.</p>
